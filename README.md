## 🤔 Inspiration 

Have you ever regretted buying a car for whatever reason? 
 
You are not alone. **46% of Americans have buyer's remorse**, where half of them never get rid of that feeling until their car is gone.  

**Why is that? Why so many years of regret and pain?**

## 🤕 Problem

Perhaps buying a car is not as easy as other people suggest. To make an *educated* car purchase, a buyer must spend **dozens of hours researching** the car market, finding the car that fits exactly for their purpose, and then deciding on the financing options.  

Sounds simple enough… **until it isn't.**  

Caveats hide throughout the entire experience — the ones that only a seasoned car enthusiast can navigate.  

Too bad that there isn't a tool that can supplement you with **real-time knowledge** of car prices, average insurance rates, maintenance costs, and overall sentiment towards the vehicle of your choice...

## 🚗⚡️ What it does

Kachow guides you through the car buying process by learning **real-time price points**, including insurance, gas, maintenance, and APRs, and lets you receive the kind of advice that can only be given by an **experienced, unbiased friend**.  

With **no AI hallucinations**, Kachow eliminates the headache of purchasing a car.  

Simply connect your bank account and let us make sure that your next car purchase isn't the **biggest regret of your life**.


## ❤️ Why Kachow

There are plenty of tools on the market that assist in picking out a car, but...  

- **We are consumer-oriented**  
- **Pick a car based on how you feel**  
- **End-to-end:** from an idea to a finalized purchase  
- **No illusions:** Straight-up prices and responsibilities  





## 🧱 How we built it

- **Front-end:** Powered by React, a little vibe-coding, and 3 Red Bulls, KaBot answers any car question you might have, while navigating a smooth modern interface.  
- **Back-end:** Enabled with the strength of Node and JavaScript, the **OpenAI-based Agent** absolutely annihilates the tasks put in front of it.  
- **Middleware:** Let's be real — nobody really reads these posts thoroughly. But if we have kept your interest thus far, please find us at the presentation table with a **sick demo** and a more detailed explanation that does not fit in this textbox.

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

The entire project was a challenge — diving face-first into the abyss of the unknown.  

How to pull the car prices? Where to get APRs? How to compete with other tools? And most importantly… **how to do all of this for free?**  

As the idea of Kachow was born in the heat of the moment, we had to navigate the waters of **expensive APIs**, **data-scraping protection mechanisms**, and fight against all odds to reach our goal.  

We struggled to put the pieces together, but we still did — creating a tool that our team can **truly be proud of**.

## 💡 Accomplishments that we're proud of

The car buying game has belonged to dealers and banks for a long time. Nobody really wanted to give away the **true financial secrets of eliminating regrets**.  

**Until now…**  

We managed to push the boundaries of what we *thought* was our skill ceiling. United by passion for cars (and coding, of course), our team wanted to help consumers **shop smarter**, make financing more accessible, and improve consumers' financial literacy.


## 🤯 What we learned

Car shopping ain't easy. Just kidding — we all already knew that...  

Here are some things that we have actually learned:  

- AI tools can't research like humans. They get complex things really well, but misinformation falls through the gaps. *So trust, but verify.*  
- APRs are a lot more of a trap than people think they are.  
- Nemotron is a cheatcode at this point.  
- Creating a real, applicable solution is a **true motivator** for pushing your limits.

## 🔮 Kachow's future

*"The lion does not concern himself with touching his hackathon project after the weekend is over..."*  

Would be something we'd say if Kachow had no potential.  

The truth is — **the car market is rough and everyone needs guidance**. Some sellers prey on uneducated buyers, and we are here to **tip the scales in your favor**.  

We would like to ensure the **robustness of our solution** and move from mock banking data to **real account integration**.
